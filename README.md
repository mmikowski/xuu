# xuu utilities

The `xuu.js` (pronounced "zoo") utility library is a stand-alone port of
the [hi\_score][_01] utility library found in `hi_score/js/xhi/01_util.js`.
The test suite, `nodeunit_xuu.js` is extracted from
`hi_score/test.d/00_xhi_libs.js`.

The version of `xuu.js` tracks that of `hi_score`.  In other words, version
1.7.11 matches the capabilties and testing of the 1.7.11 of hi\_score.

1.7.11 Makes timezone check more permissive to include a colon
1.7.10 Adds support for `_return_map_` in method `_makeTmpltStr_`
