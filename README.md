# XUU utilities

Xuu (pronounced "zoo") is the utility library extracted from the
[hi\_score][_01] project.  The version of Xuu tracks that of hi\_score. That
is, version 1.46 of Xuu will match version 1.46 of hi\_score utilities.

Version 1.4.27-6 introduces breaking changes from 1.4.27-5. Sorry about this,
but it was done to ease support by maintaining the same keys as hi-score.
